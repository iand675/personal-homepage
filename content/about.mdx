# About

I'm an engineer at Forge Global where I am the dev lead for our Data & Infrastructure group.

Previously at Betterteam, where I wore nearly every sort of engineering and product design hat.

I recently moved back to the U.S.A. after living in Japan for 4 years. I might go back at some point
and live there again, not sure yet.

A little further back, I joined CircleCI when it was smaller than 10 people and enjoyed growing with it as it expanded to about 70 folks. 
I implemented significant portions of popular features, including the V2 UI, Bitbucket Support, and
the early protoypes of what eventually became Orbs.
